# Example Hosts Configuration.
# 
# This is a basic yaml file (yaml.org) where each root level tag represents a 
# system "name" and it's children's keys represent key/values to assign to a 
# host configuration which includes the authentication details.
#
# All host entries should have the following key/values:
# host_desc             - This is just a short description which can be used
#                         for log names or whatnot
# target_service_url    - This is the URL associated with the actual API 
# auth_type             - This is the module name for the authentication used
#                         by the specified host
#
# Please note that there can be multiple hosts that use the same authentication
# mechanism. Users must ensure that each host has a unique "key" 

# Example of a basic auth configuration
dev:
    auth_type: 'auth_basic'
    username: 'admin'
    password: 'password'
    host_desc: 'Example Test'
    target_service_url: 'http://localhost:8000'
